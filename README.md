### Goal

Build a client that efficiently retrieves exchange rate data by prioritizing responses from the fastest services, discarding slower ones.

### Tools used

- Go (programming language)
- Docker (containerization platform)
- Docker Compose (orchestration tool for Docker)
- Redis (in-memory data structure store)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine before proceeding.

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/josephakayesi/cadana-exchange-challenge
   ```

2. Navigate to the project root.

   ```
   cd cadana-exchange-challenge
   ```

3. Start the exchange servers and client servers using Docker Compose.

   ```
   docker compose up
   ```

4. Access the people module and start the application that consumes data from the client server and performs manipulations on the Person objects.

   ```
   cd people
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```
